                    Schechter Method
                    This method of teaching English uses the following principle: from the first lesson, a specific task is set before the student. For example, it is necessary to ask what nationality the person sitting next to him is. Of course, the vocabulary can be very small. But this is also an advantage, because people with the same level of knowledge gather in the group. In the process of communication, mental processes are activated, and a person's thoughts switch to English.

                    The structure of the method is such that at the first stage, students study vocabulary. A little later - grammatical structures. And even later, the knowledge obtained is corrected. The principle from general to specific is implemented, in the process of which students study spoken language, and a little later - grammar.

                    Schechter's method is perfect for those who study English for travel or for informal trips. It is suitable for those who do not mind attending courses, because it is impossible to implement it in the process of individual or independent learning.

                    Berlitz Method
                    A system for learning English that is over 200 years old! Its principle is very simple: to immerse the student in an unfamiliar language environment. Today, this method is implemented through exchange studies or work abroad. The main goal is to immerse the student in a different conversational environment. He will immediately begin to learn vocabulary, and to learn grammar it is necessary in a natural conversation with native speakers.

                    The method is effective, because a person immediately understands that no one will help him. New neural connections begin to form, the memory begins to find the necessary words faster, and, at the same time, it also quickly "grabs" the words of the interlocutors. But not everyone will go to study abroad - this is obvious. There is a way out: now there are many language schools that work according to this method. They teach native speakers, and in classes no one switches to the student's native language. If you prefer individual study of English, then there is no problem either. Just find a tutor who is a native speaker of a foreign language.

                    Ilya Franko's Technique
                    This technique can be used both for independent study of English and as an addition to classes with a tutor. It consists in the fact that the student should read as many texts as possible. But this is not ordinary literature in English, but a special text that is divided into several blocks or columns. For example, a paragraph of text in English is translated next to it in a column into Russian. Next, you need to read the same paragraph or chapter, but without translation. The point is that you repeat the words several times, memorize them and move on. By the end of a year of regular use of this technique, students achieve amazing results.

                    Finding texts that are designed according to Franko's technique is easy. You can download an application to your smartphone, where you will find classic English literature, where each book will be designed for this technique. Everyone can use this technique as one of the additional techniques.

                    Pimsleur Method
                    If you have been looking for an effective way to learn English for a long time, then consider the Pimsleur Method. Its essence lies in regular half-hour classes. These are audio lessons in which information is presented in English and Russian. The material is voiced by a native Russian and English speaker. The terms of the tasks are presented in Russian and English. New vocabulary is presented in the same format. The student simply listens to new information and remembers it, thanks to regular classes and completing tasks.

                    The advantage of this technique is its convenience. For example, you can download the lessons to your smartphone and listen to them when you go to study or work. As an additional option for studying English during self-study, it can definitely be recommended.

                    Zamyatkin Method
                    If you want to learn spoken English on your own, then consider the principles of the Zamyatkin Method. It does not guarantee quick results, but allows you to learn a foreign language more deeply and qualitatively. The principle is to gradually immerse yourself in English. The author of the method recommends starting with listening to dialogues, then moving on to reading books, and only after that - watching movies. In essence, you are teaching your brain to consume information in English, not in your native language. This principle includes listening to music in English and listening to audiobooks.

                    Your task is to change the language of perception of information from your native to a foreign one. This will require a high level of self-discipline, but in a year you will see your significant progress.
